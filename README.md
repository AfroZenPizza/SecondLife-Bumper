## Files
*bumper.lsl* - **Recommended** - This version of the script requires LSL Preprocessor, but is the easies to customize and the most frequently updated.\
\
*bumper-push.lsl* - Version of bumper.lsl that pushes the agents that bump into the agent equipped with the bumper away. Requires that the sim that the agent is on allows pushing, otherwise does not push.\
\
*bumper-processed.lsl* - Does not require any proprocessor, and is updated less frequently and not as tested. This version can just be copied and pasted into the script are on any SL viewer with little fear that it will not function.
